# Introduction
You're probably wondering,
> *What in the absolute godforsaken lord is Runner?*

Well, it's a Simple Module Loader™ that Just Works™, made for developers who are too lazy to make their own I guess. It's basically Adonis plugins, but not plugins.

Again, you're probably wondering again,
> *Why in the world should I use Runner?*

I just explained it dude. Made for lazy devs who cannot code competently.
